# AttackOfTheClones

These directories come from entire outside repositories brought in using
[git-subtree](https://github.com/apenwarr/git-subtree). This means that the source files are inserted directly into
the `AtackOfTheClones` repository. They can be edited and committed just as if
they were normal files.

Source folders:

| Folder            | Upstream Repo        | Description |
